# [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/)

> Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.

## Agile plugins
These give us a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) like board, and an agile workflow, my current recommendation is the 'scrum' plugin, but I did like redminebacklogs very much while it was working.

### [scrum](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/scrum-plugin)
This [plugin](https://redmine.ociotec.com/projects/redmine-plugin-scrum)  is my preferred agile management plugin for Redmine atm

### [redminebacklogs](http://www.redminebacklogs.net/)

This [plugin](https://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs) was great, but has not made it stably to Redmine 3 yet, and their main domain has lapsed.  I fear the future of this project

### [RedmineCRM's Agile](https://www.redminecrm.com/projects/agile/pages/1)

I did not find this one very complete in an agile sense, and it is paid for, so a no go in my book. But I include it here for completeness.
