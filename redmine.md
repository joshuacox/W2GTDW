### [scrum](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/scrum-plugin)
This [plugin](https://redmine.ociotec.com/projects/redmine-plugin-scrum)  is my preferred agile management plugin for Redmine atm

### [redminebacklogs](http://www.redminebacklogs.net/)

This [plugin](https://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs) was great, but has not made it stably to Redmine 3 yet, and their main domain has lapsed.  I fear the future of this project
