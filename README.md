### What 2 Get Things Done With

This is a collection of practical examples applying [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/) , and agile methodologies into a mixture of old school lo-tech, and modern hi-tech tools.

### What is GTD?

[GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/) is "Getting Things Done", is a [book](http://amzn.to/2bUXOIS) by David Allen.  You should absolutely [buy](http://amzn.to/2bUXOIS) it and read it first.  I am writing this book both as an exercise in GTD, and as a useful set of notes on some of the practical tools that can be used given todays technologies.  

### Requirements

At a very base you'll need a computer, a pencil, and some scrap paper.  However, if you want the full arsenal I think you'll find that you already have all of the possible hardware necessary to Get Things Done:

* notepad and pen/pencil
* audio recorder
* smart phone
* tablet
* laptop computer
* desktop computer

This full spectrum contains plenty of overlap.  Especially with the smart phone that is able to act as pretty much all of the above if you attach a keyboard for sessions of serious input.
