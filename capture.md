# Capture

This is quantity over quality portion of the process, any and all thoughts that distract you must be removed from your head and tossed into a bucket that you regularly clear.  Otherwise, you will continue to think about this, however trivial it might be, and you will not get your work done.

The basics here is the pencil and back of an envelope of junkmail.  This in the very least dual purposes junk mail to have some use in life.  Keep at least one piece of paper on your and a writing instrument (pencil, pen, etc) with you at all times to 'capture' meaningful input

An audio recorder is great for the car, esepecially a dedicated one that has large buttons so you don't have to fiddle about with it while driving.  In a pinch you can use some [Android Apps](android_apps.md),
but you'll want to be very good with voice navigation of your phone (using your phone without your fingers) to drive and do such things at the same time.

Another possiblity for this is the 'todo' list inside of [Habitica](habitica.md)

The big thing here is that the buckets must be easy to access, and easy to empty.  If you have to go through too many steps, they simply will not be done.  This is the advantage of the pencil and junkmail.  You were going to throw that envelope away anyhow, might as well scribble some notes on it, and then prepare for the next chapter.
