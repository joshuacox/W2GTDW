# Organize

At this point you want to determine if something is actionable or not.  Non-actionable items in agile are called 'blocked',
because they have some other issue 'blocking' them, this blocking issue is called the 'blocker'.

### Actionable 

Ok, now to issues that are actionable.  If they can be done in under two minutes and represent no major milestone, 
put them off for just a second and organize the rest of the issues, 
we will get back to the quick ones done when we finish our organization and reflection

If not an immediately easy to do item  that can be done in under two minutes, 
or even if it is an easy item but is a milestone or otherwise deserves its own issue page,
you need to get it out of one of your primary buckets and into a backlog.

### What's a backlog?

I'm glad you asked!  Traditionally scrum defines a "product backlog" as

> The Product Backlog comprises an ordered list of requirements that a Scrum Team maintains for a product. It consists of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc.â€”whatever must be done to successfully deliver a viable product. The Product Owner orders the Product Backlog Items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, and date needed.

for our purposes let's define it as a backcatalogue of good ideas that are going to serve as our pool of things that need to be done.
This is where technology comes in handy.
For this method I'm going to recommend [Redmine](redmine.md) with the 'scrum' plugin.
In setting up this plugin for a project, it will force you to make a backlog.
Place all items [that are not quick under 2 minutes] from your primary [capture](caputre.md) buckets into the backlog now.

### Actionable and reasonably complex, and the quicklist

Now, your backlog will consit of non-actionable and actionable items.  
And your paper list should consist of most items crossed out as they have been entered into the backlog, 
or they are the last few remaining quickie items we know we can do very quickly.
