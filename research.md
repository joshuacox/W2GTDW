# Research (how to bookmark in the modern age)

Bookmarking is somewhat of a lost art, now that people have so many devices they have largely been ignored.  Sure on your work computer you might have a few work related marks, and on your phone you might have a bookmark to a crucial traffic camera, but with additional tablets, home computers, out and about laptops, studio workstations, and now even our TVs are likely to have some sort of browser in them.  Bookmarking has become a challenge.  Time to look at some tools to help sync or completely externalize (do you need offline bookmarks?) the bookmarking process.

### [Firefox Sync](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/sync/)

Firefox itslef can sync tabs, addons, and much more.  I prefer to just go ahead and organize a link into one of my online book marking apps instead though

### [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/)

One of the oldest public bookmarking services, swallowed up by yahoo at some point.  Looks like I've been on there since March of 2007, 

http://del.icio.us/th0th

this is a great option if you are comfortable with putting the links online for everyone to see, and you don't require any other organization than tagging.

### [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)

Pocket is great for sending a page to my tablet or other device to be read later (perhaps at the gym).  The big advantage with pocket is that if you sync the other device then the page can be read offline.  It also attempts to strip most web pages of their styling and present a very uniform reading style to you, which sometimes doesn't work in which case you can switch back to the original view

### [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/)

This is the most advanced of the set I've given here.  It is easily the most powerful, enouraging deep research, letting you annotate webpages and PDFs.  This is a system of research.  It has a correspondingly steeper learning curve than the others, but IMHO is one of the best out there.  My diigo:
