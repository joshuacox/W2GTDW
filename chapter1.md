# Fusing Agile and GTD into a workflow
The [five](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/) steps of [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) are thus:

### [Capture](capture.md) -
This is when we capture ideas that will form our backlog.

### [Clarify](clarify.md)
Then we clarify the ideas, and vett them, describing a final state we'd like the solution to be in

### [Organize](organize.md)
Weighting the ideas and determining which issues are blockers

### [Reflect](reflect.md)
Organize the ideas into sprints

### [Engage](engage.md)
Execute and engage your sprint

#### Agile notes
